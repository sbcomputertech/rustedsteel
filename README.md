# Rusted Steel
## A mod for [Carbon Steel](https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/carbon-steel)

### Features:
- An endless mode, to see how many pulls you can complete before failing
- A pause menu that freezes the game
- A feature that displays the creature's class/subclass on the screens after you find it using the layer analyser
- Mouse navigation on the main menu
- A [UnityExplorer](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer) intergration

### Compatibility:
The mod should work with both the itch.io version and the Steam/Unsorted Horror versions.
The only difference should be the location you extract the mod to.

### Installing:
Download [the zip file](https://github.com/sbcomputertech/rustedsteel/releases/latest/download/RustedSteelDistZip.zip) from and extract it into the game's folder.
To check, make sure that `winhttp.dll` and `Carbon Steel.exe` are both in the same folder.
If you installed it correctly, the text on the main menu should say "Rusted Steel"
